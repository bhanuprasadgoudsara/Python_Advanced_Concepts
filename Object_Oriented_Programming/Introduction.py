# About Python:
'''
Python is a open-source, general purpose, popular programming language which enables
    - scripting,
    - functional programming as well as
    - Object Oriented style of Programming.
    
Python is a Interpreted Language, and Platfrom Independent.

Python is an extensive language provides :
- supports wide range of Libraries and Built-In functions (easy and rapid development of applications).
- allows the users to store the data in different collections data tyes and apply different control structures.
- allows user to develop user-defined functions (reduces code redendency and increase the code modularity).
- supports the code organisation mechanism using modules and packages(easy development and maintenance).
- supports external falt file handling mechanism
- supports exception handling mechanism (through try and except block).

Python Applications:(libraries and Frameworks)
- Web Development (Django, Flask)
- Database access (cxOracle, SQLite, psycopg2)
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Pandas, Scikit, NumPy)
- Data Science and data visualization (Matplotlib, SeaBorn)
- BioInformatics (PyBio)
- Computer Gaming and 3D graphics (PyGame, PySoy)
- Network Programming (Asyncio, Diesel, Pulsor)
- Automation Testing (Robot, PyTest)

Python can be used for
- developing automation scripts
- applications
- web applications and
- data science applications

Python has many libraries which enables
- connectivity to databases and architectures
