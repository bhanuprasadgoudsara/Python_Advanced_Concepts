WeCare insurance company wants to calculate premium of vehicles.

Vehicles are of two types â€“ "Two Wheeler" and "Four Wheeler".
Each vehicle is identified by vehicle id, type, cost and premium amount.
Premium amount is 2% of the vehicle cost for two wheeler and 6% of the vehicle cost for four wheeler.
Calculate the premium amount and display the vehicle details.

Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

Note:

1. Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is invalid

2. Perform case sensitive string comparison'''

class Vehicle:
    vehicle_id = 1000
    
    def __init__(self,vtype,vcost):
        Vehicle.vehicle_id += 1
        self.vehicle_id = Vehicle.vehicle_id
        self.vehicle_type = vtype
        self.vehicle_cost = vcost

    def __str__(self):
        return "Vehicle id: " + str(self.vehicle_id) + "\nVehicle type: " + self.vehicle_type + "\nVehicle cost: " + str(self.vehicle_cost)

Consider the below scenario of a retail store.


 

Implement the Customer class based on the identified class structure and details given below:

    1. Consider all instance variables and methods to be public
    2. Assume that bill_amount is initialized with total bill amount of the customer
    3. Customer is eligible for 5% discount on the bill amount
    4. purchases(): Compute discounted bill amount and pay bill
    5. pays_bill(amount): Display, <customer_name> pays bill amount of Rs. <amount>

Represent few customers, invoke purchases() method and display the details.
